# Challenge 14: A Tech Blog

## Welcome

The assignment was to create a simple blog app. We were to code the front and
back end of a website that allows a user to create an account, write and save
blog posts, and store session data between visits to the website. This was 
accomplished using node, express, mysql, sequelize, and a number of other node
packages. I used bootstrap for the website's simple design.
